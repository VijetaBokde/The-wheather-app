# The Wheather App

I have created this Wheather App using HTML,CSS & JavaScript.




## Features
-  We'll use CSS Grid to lay out the list items. Remember that each list item will represent a city. 
- Their width will depend on the screen size.
- On large screens (>1000px) we’ll have a four column layout.
- on medium screens (>700px and ≤1000px) a three column layout.
- On small screens (>500px and ≤700px) a two column layout.
- On extra small screens (≤500px) all elements will be stacked.
